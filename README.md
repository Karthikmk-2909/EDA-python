ðŸš— Excited to Share My Recent Python Project on Car Dataset Analysis! ðŸš—

In my latest project, I dived deep into a dataset of cars, applying various data cleaning, formatting, and analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I accomplished:

Data Cleaning: Ensured data integrity by checking headers, identifying missing values, and handling them using mean, mode, or median. Dropped rows with non-valuable data and reassigned indexes for better clarity.

Data Formatting: Standardized data types and column names to ensure consistency across the dataset.

Data Standardization: Verified units of measurement and adjusted where necessary to maintain uniformity.

Data Normalization: Established benchmarks for each attribute and compared the rest against these standards for better analysis.

Data Binning: Transformed numerical values into grades/ranks to facilitate easier comparison.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

For numerical attributes, I used regression plots, correlation analysis, group-by operations, pivot tables, heatmaps, Pearson correlation, coefficient of correlation, and p-values.
For categorical values, I used box plots to visualize and interpret the data.
This project allowed me to hone my skills in data manipulation and analysis, ensuring that the dataset was both clean and insightful. The experience has deepened my understanding of how to extract actionable insights from raw data using Python.

Looking forward to applying these techniques to more datasets and uncovering valuable trends and patterns!
